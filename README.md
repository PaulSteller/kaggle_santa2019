## Santa's Workshop Tour 2019

This notebook is related to the Kaggle competition found here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/santa-workshop-tour-2019/overview

I start by using the Hungarian Algorithm, followed by a couple different greedy algorithms I devised. I am pretty happy where I got my score, and I hope to return to this problem in the future and try a different method to minimize the score even further.
